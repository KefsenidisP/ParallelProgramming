The best of all of them is the one without the locking mechanisms. 
It is the one that is completely parallel.

NOTE: For a run, when increasing the number of threads, results in the change of the pi value between the runs. I tried searching for an error in the parallel code, but I believe this is not an error, but it has something to do with the handlung of double precision numbers in C. This also happens for the algorithm in the next lab.
